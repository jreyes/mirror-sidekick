This is a companion application for the [Another Smart Mirror](https://github.com/jreyes/mirror) application. 
This application acts like a low energy bluetooth beacon so the Mirror application can detect when you enter the room 
for wake up and sleep functionality.

Also works to receive sharing intents from the Mirror application.
